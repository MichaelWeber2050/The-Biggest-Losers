# The-Biggest-Losers
The Biggest Losers is a web app to display the top sports podcasts from the city of a team that just experienced a bad loss.

Frequently some of the best sports commentary content comes from podcasts that cover their local market teams and air out all the laundry after a significant loss. 

Misery loves company, here comes the pain!
